# Multimeter
Arduino C project for a self made PCB implementing a simple multiple choice multimeter.
The multimeter has 5 modes that are selected with a rotary switch. The measured values are shown
on a 3-digit 7-segment display.
Multimeter modes:
1. Voltage 0 - 5V
2. Voltage 5 - 39V
3. Resistance 0 - 1 kiloohm
4. Short circuit test (0 - 10 Ohm)
5. Resistance 1 - 100 kiloohm
